## Do you

Have a lot of unread email?

Experience email overload?

Waste time looking for and re-reading emails?

'Mark as unread' so you'll go back to deal with it?

Feel anxious that you're not getting back to people?

Worry about what's lurking in the middle of your inbox?

## Merlin Mann says

1. Don't leave your email client open. Process email periodically
2. *"I don't know"* is a good answer, as is *"do you still need this?"*
3. "It’s not how many mes­sages are in your inbox–it’s how much of your own brain is in that inbox"
4. It's a process, not a state. Especially not a state that requires significant infrequent effort
5. Delete, delegate, respond, defer, do
